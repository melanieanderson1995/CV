## Melanie Anderson

Practicing artist with a creative mind but a love of logic and analytical thinking. I am currently learning Ruby and JavaScript, and my arts background is in soft sculpture about theoretical physics. Tech excites me because it is incredibly similar to spoken language, but it is even more straightforward and logical, as well as it enables me to live wherever I have internet.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

## HTML5/CSS
    I taught myself HTML5 and CSS off of Codecademy, and proceeded to build my own website from scratch. I have a good sense of design so I find CSS very intuitive and I enjoy the creative aspect of it. HTML5 I found to be relatively simple and easy to learn, as it structurally makes a lot of sense to my visual brain. You can view my HTML5/CSS coded website at www.laneandersonart.com

## Ruby
    I have been learning Ruby for just over a month now, and was able to complete all of the Codecademy lessons and numerous Kata between 8-6 Kyu on Codewars in the span of 5 days. I find it to be a very programmer friendly language, although some of it is less technical than I'd prefer. I am still experimenting with Ruby, and I understand that I have a lot to learn, but at this stage I do feel relatively comfortable with the language.

## JavaScript
    Similar to how I approached Ruby, I completed all of the Codecademy lessons and numerous Kata in the span of about a week to teach myself the fundamentals of JavaScript. While I am still quite slow at it, and I need to experiment with all of the various methods more, I find that it is more analytical so I prefer it to the other languages I know.

## Adobe Creative Suite
    Being a practicing and training artist for the past 8 years, I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have previously worked as an illustrator and I was a tattoo artist and designer for 3 years, so I relied very heavily on the Adobe Creative Suite to complete my work for companies such as KnitHub 24 (London, UK), Plan 9 Tattoo (London, UK), and Jester's Court Tattoo (Pittsburgh, PA). You can view my illustration work on my website (listed above) and at https://www.knithub24.com/
